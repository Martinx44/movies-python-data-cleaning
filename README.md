Movie Data Analysis ðŸŽ¬
This project is all about diving into a dataset of movies to see how different factors like budget, ratings, and more relate to a movie's success. We use Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for the analysis.

#What's Inside
Dataset: Info on movies like title, rating, genre, budget, gross revenue, and more.
Analysis: We explore correlations, check out data distributions, spot outliers, and see how different features relate.
Visuals: Plenty of plots and charts to make the data easier to digest.

#Getting Started
Clone the repo:

#bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moviedata-analysis.git
Install the necessary Python packages:

#bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the analysis by opening the Jupyter notebook or running the Python script:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook MovieDataAnalysis.ipynb
or

bash
Copy code
python MovieDataAnalysis.py
Key Takeaways
Budget vs. Gross: There's a strong link between how much is spent on a movie and how much it earns.
Ratings and Genres: Certain ratings and genres tend to have higher gross revenue.
Top Movies: We also look at which companies are behind the big earners.
